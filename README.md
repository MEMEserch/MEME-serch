I am just some guy who is addicted to working on a year 10 school project website. . . that already got graded

heres the link
https://meme-serch-1.tiiny.site/

update;
tiiny site has had some kind of change in there TOS and they are no longer hosting the site I am looking into what caused this to happen so I can get it back up again
(edit)
THE SITE IS BACK UP
I managed to make some minor optimizations to the site and as it turns out tiinyhost no longer supports txt files
